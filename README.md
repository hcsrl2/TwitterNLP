# Environmental Sentiment Analysis Over a Decade

This project entails an extensive analysis of public sentiment and trends regarding environmental leadership and environmental consciousness over a span of ten years (2012-2022). 

## Data Collection

- **Twitter API:** A robust collection of 10 million tweets was pulled through the Twitter API. However, due to the computational intensity, the initial analysis was performed on a randomized subset of 3 million tweets.

## Analysis Scope

- **Time Frame:** The analysis spans from 2012 to 2022, providing a comprehensive view of how public sentiment and trends regarding environmental issues have evolved over the decade.
- **Focus Areas:** The primary aim was to dissect the shifts in sentiment and trends concerning environmental leadership and environmental consciousness.
